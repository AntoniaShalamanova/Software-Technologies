                        </header>

                        <p>
                            Sophia is Hanson Robotics’ latest and most advanced robot to date and a cultural icon. She has become a media darling,                                    appearing on major media outlets around the world, igniting the interest of people regardless of age, gender, and culture,                                even gracing the cover of one of the top fashion magazines.  Her press coverage has a potential reach of over ten billion                                 readers in 2017.

                            Sophia is a highly sought-after speaker in business and showed her prowess and great potential across many industries. She has                            met face-to-face with key decision makers in banking, insurance, auto manufacturing, property development, media, and                                     entertainment. In addition, she has appeared onstage as a panel member and presenter in high-level conferences, covering how                              robotics and artificial intelligence will become a prevalent part of people’s lives. Her reputation extends beyond business                               into the global social arena. She was named the world’s first United Nation Innovation Champion by United Nations                                         Development Program (UNDP) and will have an official role in working with UNDP to promote sustainable development and                                     safeguard human rights and equality.

                            Sophia is an evolving genius machine. Her incredible human likeness, expressiveness, and remarkable story as an awakening                                 robot over time makes her a fascinating front-page technology story. Sophia’s creator, Dr. David Hanson, is the founder of                                Hanson Robotics and a modern-day renaissance man who has built a worldwide reputation for creating robots that look and act                               amazingly human. After working at Disney as an “Imagineer,” Dr. Hanson aspired to create genius machines that will surpass                                human intelligence. Dr. Hanson believes that three distinctively human traits must be integrated into the artificial                                      intelligence of these genius machines: Creativity, empathy, and compassion. As an extension of human intelligence, Hanson                                 Robotics’ genius machines can evolve to solve world problems too complex for humans to solve themselves. Sophia personifies                               this bold and responsible goal.

                            <h2>Tools for Thinking Better</h2>
                        </header>

                        <p>
                            Here's the good news:

                            You don't need to master every detail of every subject to become a world-class thinker. Of all the mental models humankind has                            generated throughout history, there are just a few dozen that you need to learn to have a firm grasp of how the world works.

                            Many of the most important mental models are the big ideas from disciplines like biology, chemistry, physics, economics,                                  mathematics, psychology, philosophy. Each field has a few mental models that form the backbone of the topic. For example, some                            of the pillar mental models from economics include ideas like Incentives, Scarcity, and Economies of Scale.

                            If you can master the fundamentals of each discipline, then you can develop a remarkably accurate and useful picture of life.                             To quote Charlie Munger again, “80 or 90 important models will carry about 90 percent of the freight in making you a                                      worldly-wise person. And, of those, only a mere handful really carry very heavy freight.”

                            I've made it a personal mission to uncover the big models that carry the heavy freight in life. After researching more than                               1,000 different mental models, I gradually narrowed it down to a few dozen that matter most. I've written about some of them                              previously, like entropy and inversion, and I'll be covering more of them in the future. If you're interested, you can browse                             my slowly expanding list of mental models.

                            My hope is to create a list of the most important mental models from a wide range of disciplines and explain them in a way                                that is not only easy to understand, but also meaningful and practical to the daily life of the average person. With any luck,                            we can all learn how to think just a little bit better.
