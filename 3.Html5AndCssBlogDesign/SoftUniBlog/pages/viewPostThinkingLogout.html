                    <p>
                        Here's the good news:

                        You don't need to master every detail of every subject to become a world-class thinker. Of all the mental models humankind has                             generated throughout history, there are just a few dozen that you need to learn to have a firm grasp of how the world works.

                        Many of the most important mental models are the big ideas from disciplines like biology, chemistry, physics, economics,                                   mathematics, psychology, philosophy. Each field has a few mental models that form the backbone of the topic. For example, some                             of the pillar mental models from economics include ideas like Incentives, Scarcity, and Economies of Scale.

                        If you can master the fundamentals of each discipline, then you can develop a remarkably accurate and useful picture of life.                              To quote Charlie Munger again, “80 or 90 important models will carry about 90 percent of the freight in making you a                                       worldly-wise person. And, of those, only a mere handful really carry very heavy freight.”

                        I've made it a personal mission to uncover the big models that carry the heavy freight in life. After researching more than                                1,000 different mental models, I gradually narrowed it down to a few dozen that matter most. I've written about some of them                               previously, like entropy and inversion, and I'll be covering more of them in the future. If you're interested, you can browse                              my slowly expanding list of mental models.

                        My hope is to create a list of the most important mental models from a wide range of disciplines and explain them in a way                                 that is not only easy to understand, but also meaningful and practical to the daily life of the average person. With any luck,                             we can all learn how to think just a little bit better.
